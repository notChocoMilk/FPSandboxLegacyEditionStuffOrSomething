Change Logs:
-----------------
well there isn't any new builds yet & literally everything gets posted in #devlogs, why does this still exist?

^ this is really for anything such as news, even though the file name is literally "NewChangeLogs" lol. having changelogs on a github repo doesn't make much sense without a version check, so just use this for game news or smth
