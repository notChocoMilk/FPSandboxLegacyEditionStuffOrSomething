Chef Pee Pee's in the kitchen, I'm the king of cooking things (yeah)
Got macaroni, pizza, cookies, and some ice cream (yeah)
And when it comes to cooking, I'm like Zeus or Hercules (yeah)
'Cause Bowser's really angry (Chef Pee Pee)
And he might just murder me (no!)
Toad wants to help but he gets all on my nerves (stop it)
He's always touching things, I'm like get out of here you turd (go)
I can make turtle soup or cook an angry bird (Big red)
Chef Pee Pee is the best, everybody spread the word
I got Goomba's in the oven (yeah)
And Penguins in the pot (the pot)
I can make a meal out of anything you've got
I can turn a rock into a pie or a souffl√© (voila)
And I can turn some cat litter into a nice cheesecake (aye!)

Chef Pee Pee is the best
Chef Pee Pee is the best
Chef Pee Pee is the best
I'm better than the rest

Chef Pee Pee is the best
Chef Pee Pee is the best
Chef Pee Pee is the best
Tell me who just made this mess
