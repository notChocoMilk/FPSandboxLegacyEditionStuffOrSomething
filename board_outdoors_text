reality's shifting to it's very core, i've finished with seconds but i still want-a more. more than pizza time &-a pizza face, this-a lap is the ultimate race! one more lap to prove that peppino is stronger, & meaner, & faster, one more lap to prove that this level is totally completely mastered, one more foe to chase me just to make things that much tougher (i forgor the rest :[ )
